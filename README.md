simple-backlight-gui
====================

A really simple bash script for controlling laptop screen brightness via GUI

Requires:
* bash (you have this)
* zenity
* gksu or kdesu
* a backlit laptop screen

This isn't meant to be clever, it's just an itch-scratcher of a program. Feel free to pull request!
